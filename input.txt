|How |

|Gravity | 
|Work | 
|Gravity | 
|is | 
|what | 
|pulls | 
|people | 
|down |

|Earth | 
|When | 
|you |

|Some | 
|people | 
|think | 
|that | 
|there |

|no | 
|gravity | 
|in | 
|space | 
|But | 
|small | 
|amounts | 
|of | 
|gravity | 
|are | 
|everywhere | 
|Gravity | 
|keeps | 
|the |

|It |

|that | 
|a | 
|person | 
|would | 
|feel | 
|very | 
|little | 
|gravity | 
|But | 
|this | 
|is | 
|not | 
|why | 
|things | 
|float | 
|on | 
|the | 
|International |

|the |

|Why | 
|Do | 
|Objects | 
|Float | 
|in | 
|Orbit | 
|So | 
|why | 
|do | 
|astronauts | 
|float | 
|in | 
|space | 
|the | 
|answer | 
|is | 
|that | 
|they | 
|are | 
|in | 
|free | 
|fall | 
|Gravity | 
|pulls | 
|all | 
|objects | 
|the | 
|same | 
|way | 
|even | 
|if | 
|they | 
|are | 
|different | 
|sizes | 
|If | 
|you | 
|drop | 
|a | 
|hammer | 
|and | 
|a | 
|feather | 
|on | 
|Earth | 
|the | 
|hammer | 
|will | 
|fall | 
|faster | 
|But | 
|that | 
|is | 
|not | 
|because | 
|gravity | 
|pulls | 
|them | 
|differently | 
|Air | 
|makes | 
|the | 
|feather | 
|fall | 
|more | 
|slowly | 
|If | 
|there | 
|were | 
|no | 
|air | 
|they | 
|would | 
|fall | 
|together | 
|at | 
|the | 
|same | 
|speed | 
|Some | 
|amusement | 
|parks | 
|have |

|On | 
|those | 
|rides | 
|a |

|at | 
|the | 
|start | 
|of | 
|the | 
|fall | 
|you | 
|and | 
|the | 
|ball | 
|would | 
|fall | 
|together | 
|the | 
|ball | 
|would | 
|appear | 
|to | 
|float | 
|in | 
|front |

|you! | 
|That | 
|is | 
|what | 
|happens |

|a |

|the | 
|spacecraft | 
|its | 
|crew |

|What |
